# üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Port Detection System

Hey everyone! Welcome to my space project! üëã 

Thank you for the amazing opportunity to work on this super cool project! I had a blast implementing a computer vision system that can detect, analyze, and navigate to a satellite port. It was such a fun exercise that really got me thinking about how we can use fundamental computer vision principles in space applications!

## üéØ What's This All About?

I tackled three main challenges in this project:
1. Finding a red circle within squares (think of it as locating a specific port on a satellite)
2. Working out how much the port is rotated
3. Moving a camera around to find the port even when it's partially hidden

## üß© The Cool Parts

### üì∏ Making the Reference Image (`base_image.py`)
First up, I created a test image with two squares and a red circle. The measurements are:
- Big square: 40x40 cm
- Small square: 20x20 cm
- Red circle: 5 cm across
- Each centimeter = 16 pixels

Getting the circle in exactly the right spot was tricky - it needs to be precisely 2.5 cm from the edges and corners. Took some trial and error, but got there in the end! üòÖ

### üîÑ Figuring Out Rotation (`mainrotation.py`)
This part was interesting! I taught the computer to figure out how much the port is rotated. You know how your brain can tell when text is tilted? I implemented something similar here!

The neat stuff it does:
- Spots the red circle using HSV color space (works way better than RGB!)
- Works out the exact rotation angle
- Tells you how sure it is about its answer

Here's a bit of the color detection magic:
```python
# Red appears at both ends of the HSV spectrum, so we need two ranges
lower_red1 = [0, 50, 50]      # Start of red spectrum
lower_red2 = [170, 50, 50]    # End of red spectrum
upper_red1 = [10, 255, 255]   # Bright reds
upper_red2 = [180, 255, 255]  # Dark reds
```

### üéÆ Finding the Port (`navigation.py`)
This was probably my favorite part! It's like a little game where the camera has to find the port. I made it move in a spiral pattern - pretty efficient way to search an area!

Check out how it moves:
```python
# The camera does this pattern:
#  ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üê ‚Üì (and keeps going, getting bigger each time)
directions = [(0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
step_size = 50  # pixels per move
```

### üëÅÔ∏è Making It All Visual (`unified_visualization.py`)
This brings everything together with some cool visuals. You can:
- Look at the port from different angles (0¬∞ to 90¬∞)
- Watch the camera searching around
- See how the port looks from different positions

## üöÄ Want to Give It a Try?

1. Get the basics installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Play around with it:
```python
# Create a test image
from base_image import SatellitePort
port = SatellitePort()
image = port.generate_image()

# Check out the rotation detection (22.5¬∞ is my test angle)
from mainrotation import EnhancedRotationDetector
detector = EnhancedRotationDetector()
angle = detector.process_image(22.5)

# Try the navigation system
from navigation import CameraNavigator
navigator = CameraNavigator()
found, commands = navigator.search_for_circle()

# See all the visuals
from unified_visualization import UnifiedVisualizer
visualizer = UnifiedVisualizer()
visualizer.visualize_unified(angle=22.5)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Need
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for the computer vision stuff)
- NumPy (for all the math)
- Matplotlib (to make everything look nice)

## üí´ Some Cool Things About It
- Works great for angles up to 90¬∞
- Finds the port pretty quickly
- Shows you exactly what it's doing
- Keeps the camera 100 cm from the port (just like a real satellite!)

## üìù Quick Notes
- Everything's in centimeters (1 cm = 16 pixels)
- Used HSV colors because they're more reliable
- Code is nicely organized in different files
- Lots of error checking to keep things running smooth

I've also tried some alternative approaches which you can find in the alternative folder - feel free to explore those too! I used LLMs to help make the code more readable while keeping my core logic intact.

Have fun with it, and let me know how it goes for you! üöÄ‚ú®
