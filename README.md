# üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Port Detection System

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my Satellite Port Detection project. This is a cool computer vision system I built that can find, analyze, and navigate to a satellite port. Think of it as teaching a camera to find a specific target (a red circle surrounded by squares) and figure out how it's positioned.

## üéØ What Does It Do?

This project helps solve three main challenges:
1. Finding a red circle within squares (like finding a specific port on a satellite)
2. Figuring out if the port is rotated (and by how much)
3. Moving a camera around to find the port when it's partially hidden

## üß© Main Parts

### üì∏ Creating the Reference Image (`base_image.py`)
This is where we create our test image. Imagine drawing two squares (one big, one small) with a red circle that touches specific points on both squares. The measurements are pretty straightforward:
- Big square: 40x40 cm
- Small square: 20x20 cm
- Red circle: 5 cm across
- Each centimeter is 16 pixels in the image

The tricky part was getting the circle in just the right spot - it needs to be exactly 2.5 cm from the edges and corners. (Trust me, this took some trial and error to get right! üòÖ)

### üîÑ Detecting Rotation (`mainrotation.py`)
This part figures out how much the port is rotated. It's like when you're trying to read text that's tilted - your brain automatically figures out the angle. Here, we're teaching the computer to do the same thing.

The cool stuff it does:
- Finds the red circle using color detection (turns out HSV color space works great for this!)
- Calculates the exact angle of rotation
- Tells us how confident it is about its answer

Here's a peek at how we detect the red color:
```python
# We look for red in two ranges because red appears at both ends of the HSV spectrum
lower_red1 = [0, 50, 50]      # Start of red spectrum
lower_red2 = [170, 50, 50]    # End of red spectrum
upper_red1 = [10, 255, 255]   # Bright reds
upper_red2 = [180, 255, 255]  # Dark reds
```

### üéÆ Camera Navigation (`navigation.py`)
This is probably the most fun part! Imagine you're playing a video game where you need to find something, but you can only see a small part of the map at a time. That's exactly what this does - it moves a virtual camera around in a spiral pattern until it spots the port.

How it searches:
```python
# The camera moves in this pattern:
#  ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üê ‚Üì (and repeat, getting bigger each time)
directions = [(0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
step_size = 50  # pixels per move
```

### üëÅÔ∏è Visualization (`unified_visualization.py`)
This brings everything together with some nice visuals. You can:
- See the port from different angles (0¬∞ to 90¬∞)
- Watch the camera move around as it searches
- See a 3D-like view of how the port looks from different positions

## üöÄ Want to Try It?

1. First, install the stuff you need:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Then you can play with each part:
```python
# Make a test image
from base_image import SatellitePort
port = SatellitePort()
image = port.generate_image()

# Test rotation detection (22.5¬∞ is our standard test angle)
from mainrotation import EnhancedRotationDetector
detector = EnhancedRotationDetector()
angle = detector.process_image(22.5)

# Try the navigation
from navigation import CameraNavigator
navigator = CameraNavigator()
found, commands = navigator.search_for_circle()

# See it all in action
from unified_visualization import UnifiedVisualizer
visualizer = UnifiedVisualizer()
visualizer.visualize_unified(angle=22.5)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Need
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for image stuff)
- NumPy (for math)
- Matplotlib (for making it look pretty)

## üí´ Cool Features
- Works really well for angles up to 90¬∞
- Usually finds the port in a few seconds
- Shows you exactly how it's thinking with real-time visuals
- Keeps the camera 100 cm from the port (just like a real satellite might!)

## üìù Good to Know
- Everything's measured in centimeters (1 cm = 16 pixels)
- We use HSV colors because they're more reliable than RGB for finding specific colors
- The code's organized into separate files so it's easy to understand and modify
- There's plenty of error checking so it won't crash on you
